The purpose of this program is to enter an hour, minute and second and it will be displayed in both 12-hour and 24-hour format.

The program also has the capability to add time and you can choose to increment the hour, minute or second.

I was really able to showcase my ability to modularize code with this project. I also had a fun time creating the methods to convert the user input time into 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

There is still work to be done, there's a bug that lies when incrementing the time past 12 or 23 hours and 59 minutes or seconds, where instead of resetting back to the first number it just increments to a time that doesn't exist (e.g. 25th hour or 61st minute.)

I also believe the code can still be refined and written more simply as well as adding comments for more readability.

When first developing this code I was struggling trying to figure out how to take a input from a user in the main file and use it in my functions file. I ended up using a setter method for this.

I believe the modularizing of the code will be very useful and trasnferable to my future projects.

I made this program readable by adding adequate white space and also including comments to help the reader understand what each piece of code does.
